# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to help look into this project!

1. Create a feature branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-change
   ```
2. Use conventional commits (`feat: …`, `fix: …`, `docs: …`).
3. Run the linters before pushing
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
4. Open a pull-request – one reviewer approval is enough.

That’s it
